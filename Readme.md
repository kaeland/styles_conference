# Learning HTML & CSS

This project follows the [Shay Howe HTML & CSS tutorial](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/). The intent of completing this tutorial is to become much better at frontend development, without relying on CSS frameworks. Ideally, I'd love to be able to script a website of my own that looks appealing.
